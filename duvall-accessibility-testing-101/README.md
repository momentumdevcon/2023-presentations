## Bio

I gained my Accessibility knowledge after a little over 3 years in the IT Department at the American Printing House for the Blind here in Louisville, KY. While there, I was always looking to provide accessible technology training, help implement more Accessible technology options, and learn everything I could to help others. 

After graduating from Code Louisville in 2018, I decided to switch from tech support to something more development oriented. I currently work as an Accessibility Engineer with CVS.

## Abstract

Accessibility is important to ensuring that everyone has access to services and information needed to help them live as independent and fulfilling of lives as possible. However, sometimes ensuring things are accessible can be a bit of a daunting process to get started with when you initially start looking into it. This talk will delve into some concepts, methods, and tools that you can use to get started on your accessibility journey. 

We'll look at features that may already be available to you in applications you use every day, as well as additional applications, extensions, and resources you can make use of. Life is rough enough, but with accessibility we can work together to make it better.
