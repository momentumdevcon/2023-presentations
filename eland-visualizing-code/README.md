## Bio

After several decades as a software engineer and engineering manager, Matt now serves as a software engineering instructor and gets to raise up future developers and unleash them upon the world to build awesome things.

Matt is a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence and a Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist and AI Engineer associate. Matt runs several blogs and a YouTube channel on data science and software engineering topics, is currently pursuing a master's degree in data analytics, and helps organize the Central Ohio .NET Developer Group while contributing to local and regional conferences.

In his copious amounts of spare time, Matt continues to build nerdy things and looks for ways to share them with the larger community.

## Abstract

What happens if we combine the fields of software architecture and data visualization? In this talk, we'll explore what the code and work item management systems we work with every day can tell us about the evolving nature of software and how we communicate it.

This talk will highlight a variety of ways to visualize codebases ranging from highly experimental perspectives to more practical and polished ways of looking at codebases.

We'll follow a data analysis workflow of seeing what data we can pull out of our systems and exploring what insights that data can tell us. We'll talk a bit more about some of the specific concerns you might have in data cleaning that relate specifically to code, source control, and work item management systems. We'll also include a discussion on how to share insights from code and specific concerns you may need to watch out for when doing so.

While the main point of this talk is to get you thinking differently about your code and how you communicate it, we'll close with a discussion of some tools out there that provide code visualization features.
