## Bio

Matt Eland is a software engineering leader and data scientist who has served as a senior engineer, software engineering manager, professional programming instructor, and has helped build enterprise-level software at a variety of organizations before distinguishing himself as a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence by using technology to accomplish ridiculous things in the name of science and teaching others.

Matt makes it his job to learn new things and share them with others through articles, videos, and talks at user groups and conferences covering a wide range of topics from software architecture to programming topics to artificial intelligence and data science.

Matt is a current data analytics master's student, an AI Specialist at Leading EDJE, wrote the upcoming book [Refactoring with C#](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Safely-improve-applications-technical/dp/1835089984/) and is making a LinkedIn Learning course on Computer Vision on Azure. Matt occasionally sleeps as well.

## Abstract

What happens if we combine the fields of software architecture and data visualization? In this talk, we'll explore what the code and work item management systems we work with every day can tell us about the evolving nature of software and how we communicate it.

This talk will highlight a variety of ways to visualize codebases ranging from highly experimental perspectives to more practical and polished ways of looking at codebases.

We'll follow a data analysis workflow of seeing what data we can pull out of our systems and exploring what insights that data can tell us. We'll talk a bit more about some of the specific concerns you might have in data cleaning that relate specifically to code, source control, and work item management systems. We'll also include a discussion on how to share insights from code and specific concerns you may need to watch out for when doing so.

While the main point of this talk is to get you thinking differently about your code and how you communicate it, we'll close with a discussion of some tools out there that provide code visualization features.
